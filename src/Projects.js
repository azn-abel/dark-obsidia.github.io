            <p> Hey there! I'm Abel Lu, a sophomore Computer Science student at North Carolina State University.
                I'm currently enrolled in Software Development Fundamentals, a Java class where I've been learning
                about software development best practices, unit testing, and finite state machines. I'm also taking
                an introductory Data Science course where I've been working with RStudio and Python. Aside from my
                coursework, I'm also working on a few personal projects, including a Genshin Impact-themed Discord bot
                made using discord.py, as well as the digital portfolio you're reading right now, made with React.js.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p> Aside from being a Computer Science student, I'm also an avid music student! Here at NC State, I'm a member
                of the Marching Band, where I play the snare drum, the Wind Ensemble, where I play percussion, and the
                Beginning Band, where I'm learning how to play the flute. I'm also a big fan of college and professional
                basketball. My favorite college team is the NC State Wolfpack, and my favorite NBA team is the Los Angeles
                Lakers. In addition to just watching basketball, I also like to play, and I get the privilege of playing
                with the best teammates I could ever ask for as a part of NC State's intramural basketball league.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p> Now that you know all about me, I'd love to get to know you as well! If you'd like to chat, feel free to
                connect with me on LinkedIn or through my "Contact Me" page. I'll be more than happy to get in touch with you!</p>
